When clicked the button will open a Tweet dialogue in the user's browser with the text and URL inserted ready for them to click \"Tweet\".\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nTweetThis does not have any dependencies (e.g JQuery not needed) because it uses native Javascript to keep things as light as possible.\r\n\r\n## Enable & Disable\r\n\r\nIf you want to globally disable TweetThisModx, head into your MODX System Settings and within the TweetThisModx Namespace look for **\"tweetthismodx.enabled\"**. Set this to **\"No\"** to disable the plugin for the entire sight.\r\n\r\nDisabling the plugin this way does not disrupt your text, it just removes the button.\r\n\r\n## CSS Styling\r\n\r\nThe idea with \"Tweet This\" functionality is that it sits within your regular copy text, perhaps on a share-worthy title or quote. For this reason the styling is minimal - so it fits in.\r\n\r\nIf you do want to style the text or button element they have each have a CSS class that you can target in your stylesheets.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to use you own class names, head into your MODX System Settings and look for the following two Settings in the TweetThisModx Namespace:\r\n\r\n**tweetthismodx.highlight_class** (Default: ttm_highlight)\r\n\r\n**tweetthismodx.link_class** (Default: ttm_link)\r\n\r\nRespectively these affect the text and the button.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know what CSS styling is or how to edit CSS files, you'll probably want to leave this alone or ask a developer to help you.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Problems##\r\n\r\nAny problems please create an issue on GitHub.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/stuntrocket/TweetThisModx\r\n\r\n",
